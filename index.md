## Portfolio

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at the University of Florida and a thermal sciences R&D intern at Sandia National Labs' National Solar Thermal Test Facility. My work focuses on scalable, cost-effective, and dispatchable energy storage systems to enable rapid decarbonization. My research at NREL, Sandia's NSTTF, MIT, and UF has focused on high-temperature thermal energy storage, alternative hydrogen production, and machine learning for energy sustainability:

I developed a machine learning model that integrates with a techno-economic model to predict the performance and cost of an external concentrating parabolic collector (XCPC), which I am converting to an open-source tool to support solar thermal adoption.
