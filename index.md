## Portfolio

I am a senior mechanical engineering student at the University of Florida and a thermal sciences R&D intern at Sandia National Labs' National Solar Thermal Test Facility. My work focuses on scalable, cost-effective, and dispatchable energy storage systems to enable rapid decarbonization. My research at NREL, Sandia's NSTTF, MIT, and UF has focused on high-temperature thermal energy storage, alternative hydrogen production, and machine learning for energy sustainability:

At NREL, I focused on advancing solutions to decarbonize industrial process heatâ€”a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Building on NREL's ENDURING project, I developed a techno-economic analysis model in Python to optimize the sizing and cost of a CSP-PV system integrated with particle TES. Our work demonstrated the system's ability to provide solar thermal energy to the Searles Valley Mining facility, one of California's largest CO2 emitters, with an LCOE of less than 3 cents/kWhth. I presented these results at the 18th Intl Conference on Energy Sustainability in Anaheim, and ASME awarded our work the Outstanding Paper Award.

### Techno-economic analysis of a PV-CSP-TES system with sCO2 power block

My first project at the NSTTF focused on the development of a TEA model for a hybrid PV-CSP system with thermal energy storage. The model helped the startup evaluate the levelized cost of electricity of their system in different geographical locations, along with optimal component sizing and operational strategies to maximize efficiency and minimize cost. I am preparing a first author paper on this work for submission to the Journal of Solar Energy.

I developed a machine learning model that integrates with a techno-economic model to predict the performance and cost of an external concentrating parabolic collector (XCPC), which I am converting to an open-source tool to support solar thermal adoption.
